# Quirks, oddities and general notes about libspotify

## Session
- `sp_session_release` will segfault (rare)
- `login` callback fires even if the login fails; instead,
  `connection_error` will fire a few moments later
- creating a session, releasing it, and then creating one again
  will segfault

## Link
- segfaults if created before a session
