# Quirks, oddities and general notes about libspotify

- HTTP links with track offset (spotify:track:7N2Vc8u56VGA4KUrGbikC2#1:40) donâ€™t
  work, even if you URL encode the hash: http://open.spotify.com/track/7N2Vc8u56VGA4KUrGbikC2%231:40
  this appears to have worked at least 7 months ago

## Session
- `sp_session_release` will segfault (rare)
- `login` callback fires even if the login fails; instead,
  `connection_error` will fire a few moments later
- creating a session, releasing it, and then creating one again
  will segfault

## Link
- segfaults if created before a session

## Track
- `sp_link_as_track_and_offset` and `sp_link_create_from_track`
  both operate in milliseconds, yet the documentation states seconds
