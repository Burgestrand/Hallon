v0.1.0
------------------
Initial, first, release! This version is merely made to
have a starting point, a point of reference, for future
releases soon to come.

- Error subsystem is covered (`sp_error_message(error_code)`)
- Image subsystem is complete, however you can only create images
  from links at this moment.
- Session API is partial. Currently you can login, logout, retrieve
  the logged in user and query user relations.
- User API is complete, but you can only create users from your
  currently logged in user (through Session) or from links.

The API is still very young, and I expect a lot of changes to
happen to it, to make the asynchronous nature of libspotify
easier to handle.
