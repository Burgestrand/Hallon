module Hallon
  # Artists in Hallon are the people behind the songs. Methods
  # are defined for retrieving their names and loaded status.
  #
  # To retrieve more information about an artist, you can browse
  # it. This will give access to more detailed data such as bio,
  # portraits and more. Hallon does not support this as of yet,
  # but you can use the underlying Spotify API for this, just like
  # we have for {Album}s.
  #
  # Both Albums and Tracks can have more than one artist.
  #
  # @see http://developer.spotify.com/en/libspotify/docs/group__artist.html
